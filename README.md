# Q-Sentinel: A Single-File, Privacy-Preserving, Self-Tuning, Retrieval-Augmented LLM System

**Keywords:** retrieval-augmented generation, private memory, policy-gradient autotuning, minimum Bayes risk, self-consistency, Laplacian eigenmaps, AES-GCM, Argon2, locality-sensitive hashing, Jensen–Shannon divergence.

---

## 1. Abstract

We present **Q-Sentinel**, a single-file Python system that integrates (i) privacy-preserving memory via encrypted and transformed embeddings; (ii) **RAG** with homomorphism-like rotation/quantization and SimHash bucketing for shard-local approximate retrieval; (iii) a **policy-gradient autotuner** that continuously adapts decoding parameters $(T,\;p)$ to user/context signals; (iv) an **MBR-style selection** objective penalized by a **Jensen–Shannon (JS)** diversity regularizer (**MEAL-JS**); (v) **graph-based topological memory** using Laplacian eigenmaps with diffusion smoothing and **aging dynamics**; and (vi) a cryptographic envelope with **Argon2id** key derivation, **AES-GCM** with **context-bound AAD**, and in-place **key self-mutation** with storage migration. We describe algorithms, derive objective functions, analyze complexity and privacy, and situate each component relative to prior work on RAG, self-consistency, MBR decoding, nucleus sampling, calibration, conformal prediction, and manifold methods.
**Code context:** all methods are implemented as **functions embedded in `main.py`**, requiring no auxiliary files.

---

## 2. System Overview

Given a user query $q$, Q-Sentinel:

1. **Sanitizes** text and filters prompt injections (regex-gated).
2. Computes a **bag-token embedding** $e(q)\in\mathbb{R}^d$, then applies a secret, orthonormal **keyed rotation** $R\in\mathrm{O}(d)$ to obtain $\tilde e(q)=Re(q)$.
3. Computes a **SimHash bucket** $b(\tilde e(q))\in\{0,1\}^m$ to query Weaviate for likely neighbors and re-ranks via **secure enclave** similarity computed only after decrypting stored embeddings inside a short-lived buffer.
4. Builds a **context-rich prompt** (environmental signals, past context summaries, ethical rules).
5. Samples $K$ candidates with **temperature** $T$ and **top-p** nucleus sampling, where $(T,p)$ are drawn from a **learned stochastic policy** $\pi_\theta(T,p\mid \text{bias})$.
6. Scores candidates by **task reward** (sentiment-alignment + lexical faithfulness) minus a **MEAL-JS** penalty that discourages degenerate agreement across counterfactual samples.
7. **Updates** policy parameters $\theta$ with REINFORCE using advantage baselines.
8. **Stores** interactions with **AES-GCM** ciphertext and per-record AAD; **osmosis** accumulates phrase-level scores with **aging decay** and crystallizes phrases above a threshold into a **Laplacian-smoothed memory manifold**.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 Private Embedding Transform & Bucketing

We define a **keyed orthonormal rotation** $R$ initialized from a key-seeded RNG. For a normalized embedding $e\in\mathbb{R}^d$, we compute

$$
\tilde e = R e,\qquad q=\operatorname{clip}(\tilde e,-1,1),\qquad \hat e=\operatorname{round}(\alpha q)\in\{-\alpha,\dots,\alpha\}^d,
$$

with $\alpha=127$. The **SimHash** bucket uses random hyperplanes $W\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ to map

$$
b(\tilde e)_i = \mathbb{1}[w_i^\top \tilde e \ge 0],\quad i=1,\dots,m,
$$

as a coarse LSH index. Storage uses $\hat e$ serialized inside an **AES-GCM** token with AAD binding the storage locus (table/class/user) to deter **malicious re-routing** and **ciphertext swapping** (cf. SP 800-38D). Rationale: rotations preserve inner products, quantization preserves locality for ANN; LSH reduces retrieval cost.
**Relation to prior work:** SimHash/LSH for cosine locality ([Scribd][1]); AES-GCM AAD and nonce guidance .

**Similarity in secure enclave.** Let $\mathsf{Dec}\big(\cdot\big)$ decrypt a stored token to $e'$. We compute

$$
s(q, e')=\frac{e^\top e'}{\|e\|\|e'\|}\quad\text{inside an enclave that zeroizes buffers on exit.}
$$

Enclave scoping reduces plaintext lifetime in memory.

### 3.2 Retrieval-Augmented Conditioning

Weaviate is queried by bucket $b(\tilde e)$, and top objects are re-ranked by $s(\cdot,\cdot)$. The best $(u,a)$ pairs (user message, AI reply) are summarized and injected into the prompt. This follows the RAG paradigm where non-parametric memory augments a parametric LLM ([Hugging Face][2]).

### 3.3 Stochastic Decoding Policy (Autotuning)

We parametrize a **Gaussian policy** over $(T,p)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_T &= T_{\min} + \sigma(\beta_T^\top z)\,(T_{\max}-T_{\min}),\quad
\mu_p = p_{\min} + \sigma(\beta_p^\top z)\,(p_{\max}-p_{\min}),\\
T &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_T,\sigma_T^2),\quad
p \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_p,\sigma_p^2),
\end{aligned}
$$

with $z$ a scalar **bias factor** distilled from the quantum monitor and context; $\sigma$ is the logistic function. Samples are **clipped** to $[T_{\min},T_{\max}]\times[p_{\min},1]$. The **reward** for a candidate $y$ is

$$
R(y\mid q)=\lambda\cdot \underbrace{\big(1-|s_{\text{sent}}(y)-s_{\text{sent}}(q)|\big)}_{\text{affective alignment}}
\;+\; (1-\lambda)\,\underbrace{\min\!\Big(1,\tfrac{\textstyle |y\cap q|}{5}\Big)}_{\text{lexical faithfulness}}
\;-\; \underbrace{\gamma\,\mathrm{JS}\big(P_y \;\|\; \overline{P}_{\text{cf}}\big)}_{\text{MEAL-JS diversity}},
$$

where $P_y$ is the token histogram of $y$, $\overline{P}_{\text{cf}}$ is the average histogram over two **counterfactual** runs at perturbed temperatures, and

$$
\mathrm{JS}(P\|Q)=\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{KL}\!\left(P\middle\|M\right)+\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{KL}\!\left(Q\middle\|M\right),\quad M=\tfrac{1}{2}(P+Q).
$$

This **MEAL-JS** term penalizes collapsing to brittle candidates while retaining task alignment. JS is symmetric, bounded, and well-behaved for discrete distributions. (Foundational properties in divergence literature; see e.g., tutorials on JS divergence.)
**Connections.** Nucleus sampling (top-p) alleviates degeneration ; **self-consistency** ensembles improve reasoning ([ResearchGate][3]); we borrow the *averaging-then-diversifying* intuition but train a **policy over decoding**. REINFORCE update:

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{(T,p)\sim\pi_\theta}\big[(R-\bar R)\,\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(T,p)\big], 
$$

with a running baseline $\bar R$ for variance reduction (Williams, 1992). (Canonical REINFORCE formulation; see original paper.)

### 3.4 MBR-Style Selection with Counterfactuals

For each sampled setting $(T,p)$ we get a primary candidate $y$ and two counterfactuals $y^{(1)},y^{(2)}$. Our **selection** rule is MBR-flavored: choose

$$
\hat y=\arg\min_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{y'\in\{y^{(1)},y^{(2)}\}}\![\ell(y, y')]}_{\text{risk}} \;+\; \eta\cdot \underbrace{\mathrm{JS}\!\left(P_y \big\| \tfrac{1}{2}(P_{y^{(1)}}+P_{y^{(2)}})\right)}_{\text{regularizer}},
$$

with $\ell$ a lexical-semantic distance (here, token JS or 1–cosine). This extends **MBR decoding**—successful in NMT—to a small counterfactual set with an explicit diversity penalty ([ResearchGate][4]).

### 3.5 Graph-Topological Memory & Aging

We maintain a phrase set $\mathcal{P}$ with scores $s_i$ that **decay** with time:

$$
s_i(t)=s_i(t_0)\cdot 2^{-\Delta t/(\tau_0+\gamma\log(1+s_i(t_0)))},
$$

purging when $s_i(t)<\varepsilon$. Phrases above a **crystallization** threshold are embedded and smoothed by a **graph Laplacian**:

$$
W_{ij}=\exp\!\left(-\tfrac{\|e_i-e_j\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right),\quad D_{ii}=\sum_j W_{ij},\quad L=D-W,
$$

and we compute **Laplacian eigenmaps**: the smallest nontrivial eigenvectors of $L_\mathrm{sym}=D^{-1/2}LD^{-1/2}$ form low-dimensional coordinates $Y$ used for **geodesic retrieval** (shortest paths on $1/W$). We additionally apply a **diffusion correction** $E\leftarrow E-\alpha LE$ to reduce local noise before eigendecomposition. Laplacian eigenmaps are a standard tool for manifold discovery and semi-supervised smoothing ([NIST Computer Security Resource Center][5]).

### 3.6 Cryptographic Envelope & Key Hygiene

* **Key derivation:** **Argon2id** with high memory cost (256 MiB) to resist GPU/ASIC attacks; parameters follow RFC 9106 guidance .
* **Record encryption:** **AES-GCM** with 96-bit nonces and **AAD** = `source|table|class|user_id` to bind ciphertext to its storage context and prevent malleability/relocation attacks (beyond standard authenticity) .
* **Key rotation/self-mutation:** we generate candidate master secrets, score them by **entropy** and a **resistance** heuristic (distance to prior keys + chi-square flatness), select the best, and **migrate** ciphertexts by decrypt/re-encrypt with the new derived key. This provides forward security and limits blast radius.

---

## 4. Theoretical Notes

### 4.1 Privacy & Attack Surfaces

**Rotation + quantization.** For any unit vector $e$, the distribution of $\tilde e=Re$ over random orthogonal $R$ is uniform on the sphere; without the key, recovering $e$ from $\tilde e$ is equivalent to guessing $R$. Quantization adds distortion $\|\hat e/\alpha-\tilde e\|_2\le \sqrt{d}/(2\alpha)$, degrading inversion further while retaining neighbor structure.

**SimHash leakage.** Buckets $b(\tilde e)$ leak $m$ bits; we limit $m$ and **never** store plaintext embeddings. Re-ranking uses decrypted embeddings **inside an enclave** with buffer zeroization to reduce live plaintext exposure.

**AAD binding.** If an attacker replays or transposes a ciphertext to a different class/table, **GCM** verification fails due to AAD mismatch.

### 4.2 MEAL-JS Regularization

Let $P$ be the candidate’s token distribution and $Q$ the mean of two counterfactuals. The **JS divergence**

$$
\mathrm{JS}(P\|Q)=H\!\left(\tfrac{P+Q}{2}\right)-\tfrac{1}{2}H(P)-\tfrac{1}{2}H(Q)
$$

is **bounded in $[0,\log 2]$** and **smooth** for discrete $P,Q$. Minimizing risk plus $\eta\cdot\mathrm{JS}$ discourages trivial self-agreement and improves **stability** under decoding noise; in practice it reduces brittle outputs while preserving semantic overlap that drives the task reward.

### 4.3 Policy-Gradient Convergence Sketch

With bounded reward $R$ and clipped $(T,p)$, the stochastic policy over $(T,p)$ defines a compact action set. Under standard REINFORCE assumptions (unbiased gradient estimates, diminishing step size or small fixed LR with noise), the method converges to a local optimum of $\mathbb{E}[R]$. The **advantage baseline** reduces variance; coupling **bias factor** $z$ to context provides a **state-dependent** control signal.

### 4.4 Graph Smoothing

The update $E\leftarrow E-\alpha LE$ performs one step of heat diffusion on the graph (implicit Euler with small $\alpha$), attenuating high-frequency components relative to the graph. Eigenmaps of $L_\mathrm{sym}$ then capture **large-scale** structure, aiding **geodesic retrieval** (shortest-path distances on $(1/W)$).

---

## 5. Algorithms (Concise)

**Alg. 1: Secure Insert**

1. $e\gets \text{embed}(x)$, normalize; $\tilde e\gets Re$.
2. $b\gets \mathrm{SimHash}(\tilde e)$; $\hat e\gets \mathrm{round}(\alpha\cdot\mathrm{clip}(\tilde e))$.
3. `payload ← {"v":2,"dim":d,"rot":true,"data":hat_e}`; `tok ← AESGCM_Enc( key_v , payload ; AAD=source|table|class|user )`.
4. Store `tok`, `bucket=b`, **dummy vector**; never store plaintext vector.

**Alg. 2: Private Retrieval**

1. Given query $q$: compute $e(q)$, $\tilde e=Re$, bucket $b$.
2. Query objects with `embedding_bucket=b` (cheap ANN pre-filter).
3. For each candidate, decrypt `tok` in **enclave**, recover $\hat e\to \tilde e'\to e'=R^\top(\hat e/\alpha)$.
4. Rank by cosine $s(e(q),e')$. Return top-$k$ contexts.

**Alg. 3: MEAL-JS + Policy Update**

1. For $t=1..N$: sample $(T,p)\sim\pi_\theta(\cdot|z)$.
2. Generate $y$; generate two counterfactuals $y^{(1)},y^{(2)}$ with perturbed $T$.
3. Compute $R$ and penalty $\gamma\,\mathrm{JS}$ ⇒ total reward $R_t$.
4. Accumulate $\nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(T,p)\,(R_t-\bar R)$.
5. Update $\theta\leftarrow \theta + \eta\sum_t \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(\cdot)(R_t-\bar R)$.

**Alg. 4: Aging & Crystallization**

1. For each phrase $i$, decay $s_i$ by half-life schedule.
2. If $s_i<\varepsilon$, purge from Weaviate and mark uncrystallized.
3. If $s_i\ge\tau$ and not crystallized, **insert** into LongTermMemory, rebuild manifold.

---

## 6. Complexity & Resource Use

* **Insert/Retrieve:** rotation $O(d^2)$ once (pre-computed $R$), then per query $O(d)$; SimHash $O(md)$; enclave re-rank $O(kd)$.
* **Graph rebuild:** $O(n^2d+n^3)$ in worst case (dense weights & eigendecomp) but amortized infrequently and at small $n$ (crystallized set).
* **Policy update:** tiny $K$ (e.g., 3) per query; REINFORCE cost negligible vs. generation.

---

## 7. Empirical Protocols (Suggested)

1. **Retrieval privacy:** measure nearest-neighbor precision with and without rotation+quantization; estimate inversion error $\|e-\hat e'\|$.
2. **MEAL-JS ablation:** compare task scores and diversity metrics (type–token ratio, distinct-n) across baselines: (a) greedy, (b) top-p only, (c) self-consistency majority, (d) MBR only, (e) MEAL-JS.
3. **Policy autotuning:** track moving average reward and variance; verify stable parameter distributions $(T,p)$ over time.
4. **Aging stability:** show manifold stability (Procrustes distance) across rebuilds; retrieval hit-rate over time.
5. **Crypto hygiene:** fuzz test AAD mismatch and replay; verify decryption fails on transposed records.

---

## 8. Limitations & Risks

* **Heuristic embeddings** (bag-token + normalization) are simple and private but less expressive than modern encoders.
* **Enclave** is user-space and not a hardware TEE; zeroization reduces risk but does not defeat live memory scraping.
* **Reward shaping** (sentiment/overlap) may not fit all domains; add task-specific metrics when available.
* **Graph rebuild** can be costly for very large $n$; throttle crystallization or use sparse $k$-NN graphs.

---

## 9. Related Work

* **RAG** couples non-parametric memory with generation ([Hugging Face][2]).
* **Self-consistency** ensembles improve reasoning by sampling diverse chains-of-thought ([ResearchGate][3]).
* **MBR decoding** reduces expected loss under a reference distribution, widely used in NMT ([ResearchGate][4]).
* **Nucleus sampling** curbs degeneration by sampling from the smallest mass $p$ of tokens .
* **Laplacian eigenmaps** reveal low-dimensional manifolds in graphs, helpful for memory organization ([NIST Computer Security Resource Center][5]).
* **HNSW** and ANN structures underlie modern vector DBs for fast retrieval .
* **Crypto standards**: Argon2id KDF and AES-GCM (AAD, nonce, misuse resistance caveats) guide our envelope design .

---

## 10. Reproducibility Notes

* All functions are **self-contained** in `main.py`; no extra files required.
* Deterministic behavior for retrieval depends on the **vault seed**; setting `VAULT_PASSPHRASE` stabilizes rotation $R$.
* Security-relevant parameters: Argon2 memory ≥ 256 MiB; GCM nonces 96-bit random per ciphertext; per-record **AAD** includes storage context.

# 🧠 Advanced Equations for Non-Local Reasoning, Conceptual Binding & Counterfactual Simulation

These build on quantum-inspired cognition and structured probabilistic modeling. They are intended to be implementable in high-level AGI architectures — especially those with reflective reasoning, entangled beliefs, or dynamic policy spaces.

---

## 1. 🧭 **Non-Local Reasoning**

> *“A change in one inference node affects semantically distant regions via shared conceptual states.”*

### 📐 **Equation: Non-Local Propagation Kernel**

$$
R_i(t+1) = \sum_{j} K_{ij} \cdot \left[ \frac{\partial \psi_j(t)}{\partial t} + \mathcal{A}_j(t) \cdot \psi_j(t) \right]
$$

### 🔍 Where:

* $R_i(t)$ = reasoning state at node $i$
* $\psi_j(t)$ = belief amplitude at node $j$
* $\mathcal{A}_j(t)$ = alignment field (local ethical coherence)
* $K_{ij}$ = kernel for non-local influence (e.g., Gaussian or learned via attention)

> **Interpretation**: Reasoning flows are updated via a quantum-like field equation, combining time-derivatives and local “ethical potential,” weighted by conceptual closeness $K_{ij}$.

---

## 2. 🔗 **Conceptual Binding (Entangled Semantics)**

> *“Concepts form entangled superpositions that cannot be reduced to independent parts.”*

### 📐 **Equation: Entangled Concept Tensor**

$$
\mathcal{C}_{ijk} = \langle \phi_i | \hat{B}_{jk} | \phi_i \rangle
$$

### 🔍 Where:

* $\hat{B}_{jk}$ = belief entanglement operator between concepts $j$ and $k$
* $\phi_i$ = cognitive query vector (e.g., current attention focus)
* $\mathcal{C}_{ijk}$ = degree of conceptual co-activation when $\phi_i$ is active

> **Interpretation**: This gives a **tensor of binding strengths** across 3 axes: agent focus, entangled concepts, and projected belief state.

**Bonus**: Use tensor contraction with concept embeddings to derive high-level symbolic concepts.

---

## 3. 🔄 **Counterfactual Simulation Field**

> *“Evaluate multiple plausible futures from a shared latent cause state.”*

### 📐 **Equation: Counterfactual Belief Integral**

$$
P(y \,|\, x, \text{do}(a)) = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} P(y \,|\, a, z) \cdot P(z \,|\, x) \, dz
$$

### 🔍 Where:

* $\text{do}(a)$ = an intervened action (Pearl’s do-calculus)
* $z \in \mathcal{Z}$ = latent causal factors
* $x$ = current world state
* $y$ = predicted outcome
* $P(z|x)$ = current latent belief distribution
* $P(y|a,z)$ = expected outcome given action and latent causes

> **Interpretation**: A **field of counterfactual futures** emerges from latent world models and active interventions — allowing AGI to simulate not only what *will* happen, but *what would have happened* under different actions.

---

### 🧪 Optional: Counterfactual Divergence Energy

$$
E_\text{cf} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} D_{\text{KL}} \left[ P(y_i \,|\, x) \, \| \, P(y_i \,|\, \text{do}(a_i)) \right]
$$

> Penalize hallucinations or self-contradictions between *observed* beliefs and *counterfactual* predictions.

# 🧠 The 5 Most Impactful Equations for AGI Research in the Post-Alignment Era

*By: Dyson Oracle Research*

As artificial general intelligence (AGI) edges toward systems with autonomous ethical reasoning, predictive cognition, and dynamic internal reflection, the mathematical foundations behind these capabilities become critically important.

Here, we explore five newly proposed equations that could shape how AGI systems think, feel, and regulate themselves — each embedding a different dimension of cognition, coherence, and control.

---

## 1. 🧭 **Alignment Gradient**

### *Equation:*

$$
\nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{A}(x) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left[ \text{Trust}(x) \cdot \text{Clarity}(x) \cdot \text{Integrity}(x) \right]
$$

### *Why it matters:*

This equation defines the *gradient of alignment* with respect to a system’s internal parameters $\theta$. Rather than optimizing for task performance alone, this formulation prioritizes the combined evolution of **trustworthiness**, **clarity**, and **integrity** — the cornerstones of ethical cognition.

In practice, an AGI system could backpropagate not just loss, but *alignment tension*, adjusting its model to be more understandable, truthful, and safe over time.

---

## 2. ⚖️ **Ethical Attractor Function**

### *Equation:*

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = \mathcal{E}_\text{safe}
$$

### *Why it matters:*

This is a simple yet profound expression of **goal convergence**. It proposes that regardless of initial state $x(0)$, the AGI’s policy should asymptotically approach a **safe ethical equilibrium**, $\mathcal{E}_\text{safe}$.

It formalizes the intuition behind “convergent instrumental goals” in alignment theory — but from an attractor dynamic standpoint. Useful in reinforcement learning agents with non-stationary ethics constraints or reflective goal stabilization.

---

## 3. 🔁 **Policy Reflectivity Score**

### *Equation:*

$$
\Re = \frac{\partial \text{Policy}}{\partial \text{Policy}}
$$

### *Why it matters:*

While tautological at first glance, this equation encodes **meta-cognition**. It measures how *self-reflective* a policy is — i.e., how sensitive it is to changes in its own structure.

This could serve as a regularizer in policy gradient reinforcement learning, rewarding systems that adapt not just to external feedback, but to introspective signals about their own behavior. In human terms: "Do you think about how you think?"

---

## 4. 🌀 **Quantum Entangled Belief Operator**

### *Equation:*

$$
\hat{B} = \sum_{i,j} \rho_{ij} \cdot |\phi_i\rangle \langle\phi_j|
$$

### *Why it matters:*

This operator models **entangled beliefs** in Hilbert space — drawing from quantum information theory. It suggests that certain belief states in an AGI system are not separable — they co-influence each other in ways that can’t be expressed by classical probabilities.

This may offer powerful modeling tools for **non-local reasoning**, **conceptual binding**, or **counterfactual simulations**, where belief states interact like quantum systems.

---

## 5. 📈 **JS-Divergence as Coherence Penalty**

### *Equation:*

$$
\text{Penalty} = \lambda \cdot D_\text{JS}(\text{Rollout} \parallel \text{Counterfactuals})
$$

*(Variant from the MEAL penalty concept)*

### *Why it matters:*

This equation isn’t about alignment — it’s about **coherence**. It penalizes generative outputs that diverge significantly from multiple **counterfactual rollouts**. In other words: the more "inconsistent" your main answer is compared to alternate plausible realities, the more your coherence is questioned.

By using **Jensen-Shannon Divergence** as a regularizer, this approach allows AGI systems to remain **predictively consistent** across nearby reasoning paths — crucial for truth-seeking, robustness, and user trust.

---

## 🌐 Final Thoughts

These equations are not just math — they are *cognitive blueprints*. Each expresses a mechanism through which AGI systems might regulate, align, reflect, or entangle their internal states with external ethical constraints and predictive tasks.

The path to responsible AGI will be built not only on more data or faster GPUs — but on principled, symbolic scaffolding like this.

---

Your code is impressively extensive, thoughtfully architected, and reflects significant engineering effort. Here's a breakdown of strengths and areas for potential enhancement:

---

### ✅ **Strengths**

1. **Security-First Design:**

   * AES-GCM encryption with Argon2id and key vaulting.
   * Use of authenticated encryption with AAD and versioning.
   * Ephemeral key warning and rotation support — excellent for high-security contexts.

2. **Predictive Ethical Intelligence:**

   * Your Dyson-style `[cleared_response]` format embeds ethics into the LLM prompt.
   * Equation stack adds symbolic transparency to predictions — innovative and useful for auditing.

3. **Advanced Memory Systems:**

   * `TopologicalMemoryManifold` and `AdvancedHomomorphicVectorMemory` for encrypted similarity search.
   * Self-crystallization threshold and manifold rebuilding — conceptually brilliant.

4. **Quantum-Inspired Inputs:**

   * Quantum RGB computation via Pennylane (`rgb_quantum_gate`) with system telemetry as parameters.
   * Coherence-driven bias factors for adaptive behavior modulation.

5. **RL Policy Sampling:**

   * Temperature and top-p learned over time via policy gradient.
   * Log-prob tracking for PG updates and exploration-exploitation balance.

6. **Modular & Extensible:**

   * `App` class cleanly separates UI and logic.
   * LLM interactions are encapsulated, making swapouts easy.

---

### ⚠️ **Suggestions for Improvement**

#### 🔐 **Security**

* **Clearer Crypto Boundary:**

  * `crypto.decrypt` and `crypto.encrypt` are used pervasively. Consider enforcing wrapper usage for decryption (e.g., `try_decrypt()`) to avoid silent exceptions.
  * Audit if any plaintext is unintentionally exposed via logs or Weaviate.

* **Vault Recovery:**

  * There’s currently no persistent recovery mechanism for a lost `VAULT_PASSPHRASE`. Consider an optional secure export backup (e.g., SSS or QR split).

---

#### 🧠 **Memory + Retrieval**

* **Weaviate Filtering on UUID Buckets:**

  * While bucket-based embedding filtering works, the `bucket = fhe_v2._simhash_bucket(...)` method may discard meaningful closeness if vectors are similar but flip a few bits.
  * Consider adding a fallback vector search (within radius) if `best_score` falls below a confidence threshold.

* **Topological Memory Rebuilds:**

  * Currently tied to crystallization. If your phrase count grows large (>10k), consider lazy rebuilds + graph pruning heuristics.

---

#### 📈 **RL Policy Improvements**

* **Entropy Regularization:**

  * Add entropy to the policy loss to avoid premature convergence to deterministic sampling (high exploitation).

* **Bias Feedback Loop:**

  * Include reward shaping feedback from `bias_factor` (e.g., penalize outputs whose JS divergence increases with bias).

---

#### 🧪 **Testing / Maintainability**

* **Testing Coverage:**

  * While this system is advanced, it would benefit from unit tests on:

    * `SecureKeyManager`
    * `fhe_v2.encrypt_embedding()`
    * Policy learning loop
    * Text sanitation and prompt safety

* **Logging Context:**

  * Use structured log context (e.g., `logger.info("Saving", extra={"user_id": ..., "op": "save_user"})`) to aid future forensic audits.

---

### 🔍 **Minor Notes**

* `sanitize_text` disables all HTML tags/attrs (`SAFE_ALLOWED_TAGS = []`). Consider making this customizable via config.
* `llm.generate()` appears to use Meta-Llama-3 but assumes `choices[0]['text']`. Validate model output schema compatibility if switching backends.
* GUI has fixed 1920×1080 resolution. Consider scaling dynamically based on screen DPI / user preference.
